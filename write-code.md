# Write Your Story With Code
## Code Tools
## Javascript Variables
Let's learn about variables. Head to [jsbin and click run](http://jsbin.com/laweped/edit?js,console), then see if you can complete the exercise.

## Javascript Data Types
Let's run some more code in Jsbin [here](http://jsbin.com/fixoqe/edit?js,console).

## Javascript Functions
Functions allow Javascript to perform tasks. Using a function is basically like casting a spell
![adding our variable cards](assets/images/spell.gif)

Each function can take inputs called arguments. We're going to use a site called JSbin to examine some functions. [Head over there and click run to try it](http://jsbin.com/zeleko/edit?js,console). 

What did this function do? 
What arguments did it use?

### :tada: **Activity** :tada: Cast a spell
Head on over to [Jsbin](http://jsbin.com/sotomim/edit?js,console) and click "run." Then try it yourself!

### :tada: **Activity** :tada: Find the bug
Head back over to [Jsbin and run the code](http://jsbin.com/rolaca/edit?js,console). Did you get the answer you expected? 

Can you fix it?

## Documentation

Most APIs have something called documentation, which tell you the correct way to use them. You can find Facebook Messenger's [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/). I'll tell you a bit about how to use it, but feel free to browse around. 

For now let's take a look at [Button Template](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/template/button). The Button Template is one of several different message templates available for Facebook chatbot messages. You saw it used in our test messages. If you scroll down you'll see what you need to send to the API to create one. Take a look at it. While it might look a bit complicated, it's made up of what we just saw before. What data types do you see?

```json
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "recipient":{
    "id":"<PSID>"
  },
  "message":{
    "attachment":{
      "type":"template",
      "payload":{
        "template_type":"button",
        "text":"What do you want to do next?",
        "buttons":[
          {
            "type":"web_url",
            "url":"https://www.messenger.com",
            "title":"Visit Messenger"
          },
          {
            ...
          },
          {...}
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}' "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/me/messages?access_token=<PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

:tada: **Activity** :tada:
Discuss what the example parts might mean and what data types they contain. See if you can find an example of a:

* String
* Object
* Array


### :tada: **Activity** :tada:
We're going to practice writing some functions using a site called [jsbin](http://jsbin.com/zuseqe/edit?js,console). See if you can get the myFunction to run and get you the secret code word. Then see if you can write your own function.


### :tada: **Activity** :tada:
Check out lines 19-53 in your actions.js, see if you can get your chatbot to respond with the 4 secret messages coded in this code. 


## Add Your Story To A Function
Remember the example from the documentation? Well we won't need to write anything like that because we are using a function that will format our message for us. 

Checkout line 55 in your Glitch app to see the function receivedPostback. Head over to messages.js to check out the function it calls - sendButtons. 
### :tada: **Activity** :tada:
What arguments does sendButtons take? What kind of data does receivedPostback use when it calls sendButtons? What would you do if you wanted to add more buttons or change a message?

Try completing the code in [this exercise](http://jsbin.com/ketuhek/edit?js,console) to respond with the following


> "you successfully triggered this conditional"

> "successfully called testSendMessage"

> "your message is" *your message*

> "the buttons are:" *your buttons*



### :tada: **Activity** :tada:
Think of action names for your questions that describe them but are simple lowercase words that are easy to code in, put them on *yellow* :yellow_heart: notecards next to their corresponding question (the :green_heart: *green* cards). 
![adding our variable cards](assets/images/cards-story2.jpg)

The example actions here are:
* get_started
* goodbye
* life
* dislikes
* town
* family
* books
* dreams
* likes


Now we'll add them to our postback function, so that each time a button corresponding to the yellow cards we just created is pressed, the correct message and following buttons are presented:


```javascript
  // if our payload/action is "get_started", send them a message with the following buttons
  if (payload === "get_started"){
     var messageText= "Oh hello! Sorry I didn't notice you, I've been reading this wonderful book. It's my favorite part becauseâ€”you'll see Here's where she meets Prince Charming But she won't discover that it's him 'til Chapter Three!";
     var buttons = [
     {
      type:"postback",
      payload:"likes",
      title:"Your likes"
    },
    {
      type:"postback",
      payload: "life",
      title: "Your life"
    }
    
    ];
    Messages.sendButtons(senderID, messageText, buttons);
  }
```

The function should refer to the following green cards below it in the outline, or if there are no more left, to the goodbye message
```javascript
  if (payload === "dislikes"){
    var messageText = "Well there is this man in town named Gaston. Boorish, brainless. He thinks I would want to be his wife. Can you imagine?"
    var buttons = [
    {
      type:"postback",
      payload:"goodbye",
      title:"Goodbye"
    }

    ];
    
    Messages.sendButtons(senderID, messageText, buttons);

  }
  
```

These are already coded into the example app, you can simply change the wording. If you need more of them, you can copy and paste. Once you've finished it's time to test your bot out. Does it work? 




```javascript
```
