# Add More Functionality To Your Chatbot

## Add your friends as testers
So right now your bot will only work for you. If anyone else messages your page, they will not receive messages from the bot. You can add your friends or family as testers though and then the bot should respond to them. To do this go to your app page developers.facebook.com and click "roles". Then click "add testers."

If you'd like to get your app officially released and accessible for everyone, [you'll need to go through the approval process, which is beyond the scope of this class, but you can email me for help](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/app-review/).

## Send pictures
The receivedMessage function in action.js also sends a picture in response to one message. It uses the sendImage function, which takes the sender id and the picture url as arguments. You can use that function too and it's easy. Click on the assets directory in your Glitch app.

you can just drag images here, and then click the image to get the URL
![add images](assets/images/copy-image-url.jpg)

Then you can use the url as the argument in the function. 



## Respond to text messages
We learned a little bit about how the text messages worked when we learned Javascript conditionals. Right now the bot has a bit of functionality in this area. But what if you want to add your own custom responses? We'll need to modify the receivedMessage function in action.js.
